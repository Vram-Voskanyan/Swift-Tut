####### Example. 
``` swift
class MediaItem {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class Movie: MediaItem {
    var director: String
    init(name: String, director: String) {
        self.director = director
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
 
class Song: MediaItem {
    var artist: String
    init(name: String, artist: String) {
        self.artist = artist
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}

let library = [
    Movie(name: "Casablanca", director: "Michael Curtiz"),
    Song(name: "Blue Suede Shoes", artist: "Elvis Presley"),
    Movie(name: "Citizen Kane", director: "Orson Welles"),
    Song(name: "The One And Only", artist: "Chesney Hawkes"),
    Song(name: "Never Gonna Give You Up", artist: "Rick Astley")
]
// the type of "library" is inferred to be [MediaItem]

var movieCount = 0
var songCount = 0
 
for item in library {
    if item is Movie {
        ++movieCount
    } else if item is Song {
        ++songCount
    }
}
 
println("Media library contains \(movieCount) movies and \(songCount) songs")
// prints "Media library contains 2 movies and 3 songs"
```

#### Downcasting
``` swift
for item in library {
    if let movie = item as? Movie {
        println("Movie: '\(movie.name)', dir. \(movie.director)")
    } else if let song = item as? Song {
        println("Song: '\(song.name)', by \(song.artist)")
    }
}
 
// Movie: 'Casablanca', dir. Michael Curtiz
// Song: 'Blue Suede Shoes', by Elvis Presley
// Movie: 'Citizen Kane', dir. Orson Welles
// Song: 'The One And Only', by Chesney Hawkes
// Song: 'Never Gonna Give You Up', by Rick Astley
```

#### Type Casting for Any and AnyObject
``` swift
let someObjects: [AnyObject] = [
    Movie(name: "2001: A Space Odyssey", director: "Stanley Kubrick"),
    Movie(name: "Moon", director: "Duncan Jones"),
    Movie(name: "Alien", director: "Ridley Scott")
]

for movie in someObjects as [Movie] {
